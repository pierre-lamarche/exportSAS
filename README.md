This R function just aims at constituting an alternative to the function `write.foreign` from the package `foreign`. The existing `write.foreign` misses several features that may be useful when translating R data into SAS:
* Labels for the variables (since it is now very well handled in R, especially when using RStudio)
* Management of possible different end-of-line characters, in particular when R and SAS are working on different OSs
